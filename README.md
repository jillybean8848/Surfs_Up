# Surfs_Up

## Overview

W.Avy has been propositioned to invest in a new surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu. Before committing, W.Avy would like to take a deeper look at the weather patterns for the area as he previously made an investement and was affected directly by weather. His main concern is bad weather forcing the shop to close frequently directly affecting business. In order to keep our investor on board we were able to use SQLAlchemy to query the SQLite database and collect weather data specifically for Oahu, Hawaii. 

## Results
